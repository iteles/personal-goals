# personal-goals
Finally _making_ time for this repo, 1 pomodoro every day to track progress! :rocket:

I'll be starting with some bigger general goals which will be
refined and broken down.
Already below, they start big and start to get more precise and smaller.

> I will be dedicating at least 1 pomodoro a day to advancing these!


+ To create products and experiences that help people understand and realise their potential, through technology
+ To never have to work full time for a third party again
+ To not have to work full time by the time we choose to start a family (+ to start one)
+ To make myself replaceable in every business we start within 1 - 2 years of starting it (depending on the business)
  + This is not for my benefit, but I have found that it is a solid foundation for any business to not be entirely dependent on a single person's skills or knowledge to survive
+ To live a healthy and sustainably happy lifestyle
+ To do 4 things every year to reduce my eco-footprint (and none to worsen it)
+ To learn to create 1 new habit every month, rather than trying to radically change my life all at once
+ To have learnt enough by planting season about growing food that I can start eating things we grow in 2018
