## Meal Plans

> **One Rule:** If anyone wants to partake in any of this food, just mention it in an issue and I'll make enough for more than just me

I didn't want to delay this any further so rather than waiting to complete
https://github.com/iteles/personal-goals/issues/6, or waiting until I've written
or researched an app that does meal planning the way I want it, here's the simplest
MVP:
+ Smoothies for breakfast & soups for dinner whenever possible
  + Leftovers for dinner whenever I want some actual food
+ One new never-before-tried recipe a week at least
+ Learn what features I need by starting super simple
  + I've found that apps that are out there are either country-specific or
  what seems like total overkill on features

Things I found during planning to have in the near future:
+ Next week - [Eggplant cannelloni](http://www.everylastbite.com/2016/01/26/eggplant-cannelloni/) - already have the filling in the freezer
(notes for this were that I tripled the leafy greens, added extra oat milk as needed
by blender and added extra parmesan - didn't have nooch on hand - kept tasting)
+ [Lazy Girl Chicken Quinoa Enchiladas](https://pinchofyum.com/lazy-girl-chicken-quinoa-enchiladas) -
Add more veggies, particularly spinach, serve with sprouts (for ex) and make when we've unpacked our kitchen
